# Giza
Giza is a project management web application. Written using the Java J2EE, it is cross-platform and cross-database.

The first project in history is the building of The Great Pyramid of Giza. For this reason this project was named after The Great Pyramid of Giza.

2570 BC: The Great Pyramid of Giza completed
The Pharaohs built the pyramids and today archaeologists still argue about how they achieved this feat. Ancient records show there were managers for each of the four faces of the Great Pyramid, responsible for overseeing their completion. We know there was some degree of planning, execution and control involved in managing this project.
